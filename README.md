# Webpack React Redux workflow

This represents a starting point for my React apps. I'll try to keep this repo near--not at--the bleeding edge. So no es7, no babel-node, no cssnext for now. I do intend to include very new technologies as they become more stable.

## Features
- redux with redux DevTools
- react-redux library to easily connect to the redux store
- eslint (airbnb-config, slightly modified)
- css-modules with @value
